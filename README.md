# Grepy2

Grepy is a Windows utility that allows you to quickly and easily search through files for a text string.

Features:

 - Allows you to search through files for text using regular expressions. 
 - The search results window displays file text before and after the search match to let you see the context around the match. 
 - Grepy has a clean and uncluttered interface that allows you to search for what you want with minimal keystrokes and mouse clicks. 
 - Uses Windows File Explorer integration so you can quickly search specific folders by right-clicking on them. 
 - Saves previously used search expressions, filespecs and folders in a drop down list so you can quickly reuse previous entries (saves typing). 
 - Saves the position and size of all windows, sliders and column sizes so the layout stays the way you want it to be. 
 - Will automatically skip binary files (.exe, .obj, .lib, .bin, etc.) during searches to save time. 
 - Lets you assign a custom editor application to use to open files (to override the default Windows File Association). 
 - Uses a configurable number of background threads for file searching which allows you to immediately open files as the search results are populated. 
 - Grepy is small (loads quickly) and fast (searches very quickly). 
 - If you have the [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) search engine installed, Grepy will automatically use it to collect the list of files to be searched.
