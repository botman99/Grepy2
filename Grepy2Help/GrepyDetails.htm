Below is a screenshot of Grepy explaining in detail what is displayed in each section of the application.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Section 1</b> - Displays the main menu for Grepy.  From the main menu, you access the Search feature, change Options settings in the application, change how search results are Viewed and have access to this Help file.<br>
<br>
<b>Section 2</b> - Displays the statistics for the results of the search.  This includes the text string that was searched for (in this case "new") and the file specification used for the search (in this case "*.cs").  It indicates how many times the search string was matched in the files searched and how many files contained matches.<br>
<br>
<b>Section 3</b> - Displays the file information from the results of the search.  It displays the file name, the file type, the folder containing the file, the number of times the search string was found in that file, the size of the file and the date and time that the file was last modified.  You can click on the heading for any of these columns to sort the file information by that category (for example, click on the "Matches" heading to sort by the number of times the search string was found in each file).  Note that the date is in Year/Month/Day format  (for easier sorting).<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> You can double click on a row in Section 3 to open the file in a text editor.  You can use the mouse right click in Section 3 to copy file names to the clipboard or to export this section to a CSV (comma separated values) file.<br>
<br>
<b>Section 4</b>  - Displays the search results for each file.  Initially, this pane will display the matches from all the files displayed in Section 3.  You can click on a specific file in Section 3 to have this section display only the matches from that specific file.  In the "View" menu, you can click the "All Search Matches" to have Section 4 display the search results from all files again.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> You can use the mouse right click in Section 4 to bring up a menu to select lines, copy to clipboard, or open a file in the editor.  You can Ctrl + mouse left click to open a file in the editor (as long as you click on a line with text and not a blank line between text).<br>
<br>
<b>Section 5</b>  - Displays a progress bar that is active while a search is in operation.  It will also display how many folders and files will be searched looking for a match of the search string.<br>
<br>
<b>Section 6</b>  - These sliders are used to control the amount of Preview text displayed above and below the search match when the file is displayed in Section 4.  You can adjust the Before or After slider to increase or decrease the number of lines displayed before the search match line and after the search match line (respectively).  The range of the Before and After sliders is 0 to 5 lines of text.<br>
