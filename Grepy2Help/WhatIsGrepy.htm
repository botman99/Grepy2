<center>What Is Grepy?</center><br>
Grepy is a Windows utility that allows you to quickly and easily search through files for a text string.<br>
<br>
Features:<br>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to search through files for text using regular expressions.</li>
<li>The search results window displays file text before and after the search match to let you see the context around the match.</li>
<li>Grepy has a clean and uncluttered interface that allows you to search for what you want with minimal keystrokes and mouse clicks.</li>
<li>Uses Windows File Explorer integration so you can quickly search specific folders by right-clicking on them.</li>
<li>Saves previously used search expressions, filespecs and folders in a drop down list so you can quickly reuse previous entries (saves typing).</li>
<li>Saves the position and size of all windows, sliders and column sizes so the layout stays the way you want it to be.</li>
<li>Will automatically skip binary files (.exe, .obj, .lib, .bin, etc.) during searches to save time.</li>
<li>Lets you assign a custom editor application to use to open files (to override the default Windows File Association).</li>
<li>Uses a configurable number of background threads for file searching which allows you to immediately open files as the search results are populated.</li>
<li>Grepy is small (loads quickly) and fast (searches very quickly).</li>
<li>If you have the <A href="https://www.voidtools.com/">Everything</a> search engine installed, Grepy will automatically use it to collect the list of files to be searched.</li>
</ul>
