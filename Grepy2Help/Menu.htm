<br>
<b>File</b> - The File menu allows you to Exit from the application.<br>
<br>
<b>Search</b> - This opens the Search dialog where you specify the text string you wish to search for, the file specification you wish to use while searching and the folder where you wish to search (along with other options that control whether you want case sensitive searches, regular expression searches, etc.).  The Search dialog can also be opened by using Ctrl + F as a keyboard shortcut.<br>
<br>
<b>Options</b> - This menu item opens the Options dialog where you can set application settings (like enabling or disabling Windows File Explorer integration, changing the number of search worker threads, and assigning a custom editor to use to open files from the search results).<br>
<br>
<b>View</b> - The View menu allows you to switch to a vertical layout or a horizontal layout (the default).  The View menu also contains an "All Search Matches" item that allows you to display the search results from all files after you have clicked on a specific file to limit the search results to just that one file.<br>
<br>
<b>Help</b> - This menu item opens this help file.<br>
<br>
<b>Stop Search</b> - This menu item will only be displayed while a search is in progress.  If you wish to cancel a search before it is done, you can click on the "Stop Search" menu item.  Any results that have already been found will still be displayed so you can cancel a search early if you find what you want before the search is complete.<br>
